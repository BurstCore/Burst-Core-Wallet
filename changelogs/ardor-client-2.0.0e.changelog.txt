This is the first release of the Ardor software, for testnet only. It represents
the first milestone in the building of the Ardor platform.


== New Features ==

The main new user-visible feature is the existence of a single forging chain,
using the ARDR token, and multiple child chains, each with its own token.


== Forging Chain ==

The Ardor chain is used to establish the proof-of-stake consensus, using ARDR
balances only. It supports only a few transaction types: ordinary payments,
balance leasing, and coin exchange. Prunable plain or encrypted message
attachments are also supported, but not permanent or standalone arbitrary
message transactions.


== Child Chains ==

The child chains support all transaction types as previously implemented on the
Nxt platform, with the exception of balance leasing which is only available on
the Ardor chain, and tagged data extend transaction which has been removed as
unnecessary. A child chain can optionally be configured to disable certain
transaction types, which has been done for testing purposes on the EUR child
chain, disabling the Asset Exchange and Digital Marketplace.


== Coin Exchange ==

To allow trading of child chain coins to each other, and also between child
chains and the Ardor chain, a new Coin Exchange module has been implemented.


== Bundling ==

The bundling process is used to group child chain transactions from a child
chain into a transaction on the Ardor chain. Bundlers accept the fees from
those child chain transactions, in the corresponding child chain coin, and
pay fees in ARDR to the parent chain forgers. Bundlers can be started from
the cogwheel/bundlers menu, defining the coin to ARDR exchange rate they accept,
a limit on the total fees in ARDR a bundler will pay, and an optional overpay
amount.


== Peer Networking ==

The peer networking has been fully re-written and optimized to use socket
connections and binary messages instead of http and JSON.
The hallmark feature has been removed, hallmarks are no longer supported.


== New APIs ==

APIs of the new Coin Exchange feature:
ExchangeCoins, CancelCoinExchange, GetCoinExchangeOrder, GetCoinExchangeOrders,
GetCoinExchangeOrderIds, GetCoinExchangeTrade, GetCoinExchangeTrades,
GetExpectedCoinExchangeOrderCancellations, GetExpectedCoinExchangeOrders,
GetLastCoinExchangeTrade.

Bundling related APIs:
BundleTransactions, GetBundlers, GetBundlerRates, StartBundler, StopBundler.

Other new APIs:
GetBalances, GetEffectiveBalance, GetFxtTransaction.


== API changes ==

All APIs that are now chain specific accept a new chain parameter.

Transaction IDs are no longer 64-bit longs but 256-bit hashes, necessitating
change in all APIs that accept transaction ID parameters or return such in the
JSON fields.

Prices and rates are now defined relative to a whole unit of the holding being
bought or sold (asset, currency, coin), not to a QNT indivisible unit.

All "units" parameters in the Monetary System APIs have been renamed to
unitsQNT.

DividendPayment API accepts holding and holdingType parameters to allow paying
dividends in another asset or MS currency.

The GetAccount API no longer returns balanceNQT and unconfirmedBalanceNQT, as
balances are now chain specific. The GetBalance API should be used to get chain
balances instead, or GetBalances for querying multiple chains.

The following APIs have been removed: ExtendTaggedData, GetPhasingPolls,
GetTaggedDataExtendTransactions, GetInboundPeers, MarkHost, DecodeHallmark.


== Testnet accounts ==

The testnet genesis block has been created based on account balances from the
Nxt testnet, as of 2017/01/01 (block height 1061208). Users who had testnet
accounts as of that height should find their ARDR and NXT testnet balances
imported into this testnet, to ARDR and IGNIS tokens repsectively, plus an
approximately equivalent amount of BTC, USD, and EUR child chain coins for
testing. To allow for developers testing and running forging and bundling nodes,
account holdings have been reduced by 50% which have been allocated to
developers accounts.


== Upgrading from Nxt ==

The Ardor release is not an upgrade and does not in any way affect your existing
Nxt account or client installation. Both Ardor and Nxt should be possible to run
simultaneously on the same machine, as long as the hardware capacity allows it.

The included ArdorNxtComparison.pdf document summarizes the major differences
between the Nxt and Ardor platforms, for those deciding which one is a better
fit for their use case, or considering a migration from Nxt to Ardor. More
documentation should be added as Ardor development and features mature and
stabilize.
