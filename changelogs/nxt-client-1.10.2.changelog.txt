Changed default setting of nxt.apiServerCORS to true in nxt-default.properties,
to enable cross origin filter on the API server by default.

Added CORS peer service field, showing whether CORS is enabled for open API
nodes.

Recalculate NRS.isLocalhost when api proxy is enabled and blockchain download
has finished. Fixed starting funding monitor when running on remote host.

To protect against brute force attacks on the admin password of public nodes,
after 3 unsuccessful login attempts the remote host is blacklisted for 1 h.
