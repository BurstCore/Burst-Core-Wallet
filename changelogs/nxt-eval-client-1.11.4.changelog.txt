This is a testing and evaluation version based on NRS release 1.11.4.

It contains the following modifications:

There are 10 hardcoded genesis recipient accounts with passwords "0" to "9"
and 100,000,000 NXT initial balance each.

The genesis account with a password of "Nxt" is allowed to send transactions
even though its balance is negative.

The software is configured to run as testnet only, ignoring the value of the
nxt.isTestnet property.

All modifications specific to the current Nxt public blockchain have been
removed.
