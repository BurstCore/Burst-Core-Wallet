This release adds transaction replay protection, to be enabled at the hard fork
scheduled for block 1,000,000. Upgrading to 1.10.1 or later before that block
is mandatory for all.

The ecBlockId and ecBlockHeight transaction fields, previously populated but
not used, will begin to be used for enforcing that a transaction submitted on
one blockchain or fork will not be accepted on another blockchain or fork that
shares the same code. These fields by default will be set to a block 720 blocks
behind the last block at the time the transaction is created, and transactions
will only be accepted if their ecBlockId and ecBlockHeight values point to an
existing block when they are included in the blockchain. This default setting
provides protection against replaying the transaction on a hard fork that has
diverged more than 720 blocks from the one where the transaction was created.

Light clients that have no way of verifying the ecBlock values returned by a
remote node will use hardcoded values, to be updated manually at some releases.
Transactions from legacy light clients that leave eBlockId and height set to 0
will still be accepted, but cannot benefit from such replay protection.

All CreateTransaction APIs now accept additional ecBlockId and ecBlockHeight
parameters, allowing the default values to be overridden by the client.

Minor bugfixes and UI improvements.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.11, delete the old lib folder before unpacking on
top.
