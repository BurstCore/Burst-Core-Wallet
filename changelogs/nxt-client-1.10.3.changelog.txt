Removed old code, the Ardor distribution UI, and the getFxtQuantity API, as the
Ardor distribution is now complete.

Blacklist peers of version older than 1.10.1.

As a performance optimization, the ARDR asset distribution data is now loaded
from the conf/fxt.json for production and conf/fxt-testnet.json files for
testnet, instead of being recalculated during blockchain download. If those
files are missing, and a rescan or redownload is performed, snapshot data will
be calculated again and saved as the corresponding json file in the nxt folder,
thus allowing independent validation of the hardcoded distribution data.

Added ShapeShift support to the desktop wallet by using a proxy servlet on the
local node.

The security manager which is automatically enabled when add-ons are in use now
allows add-on network connections.

Added nxt.disableSecurityPolicy property to disable the security manager even
when add-ons are in use, in order to improve performance, default false.

Added nxt.keyStoreType property to configure the keystore type used, default
is JKS.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.12 and Bouncy Castle to version 1.55, delete the
old lib folder before unpacking on top.
