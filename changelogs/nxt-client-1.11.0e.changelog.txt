Added Generators page (under the cogwheel menu), showing the predicted next
block generators.

When working as a roaming or light client, data returned by the remote node is 
validated against other remote nodes. In case of a difference a visual 
indication is displayed on the toolbar to warn the user that the data returned 
by the remote node may not be consistent.

The user interface files are now located under html/www instead of html/ui,
as this is the path required by the Apache Cordova framework used by the
mobile wallet.

The lockup screen now displays a button group of "by account", "by passphrase", 
"by QR code" login options side by side above the credentials entry field, 
instead of the old "By Account" / "By Password" toggle button.

Scanning a QR code for login, has been implemented by clicking the QR code icon
on the lockup screen. When the value scanned matches an NXT account format it
will be treated as account login, otherwise the value scanned will be treated
as the account passphrase.

The old "Remember Account" and "Remember Passphrase" checkboxes were merged 
into a single "Remember Me" checkbox.

Save passphrase in local storage when using passphrase login with "Remember Me"
checked. Choosing logout will clear this data.

Account and passphrase entry fields on modal dialogs now support scanning the
value from a QR code by clicking the QR link above the field.

When logging in with passphrase and the "Remember Me" checkbox checked, the 
"Account Details" modal will display the QR code for the account passphrase 
in addition to the QR code for the account id.

Experimental support for running the client wallet as a mobile app has been 
added. See specific documentation at https://nxtwiki.org/wiki/Mobile_App

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.13, delete the old lib folder before unpacking on
top.
