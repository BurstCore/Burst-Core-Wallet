This is the first stable release in the 1.9 series. Update to this release on
mainnet is optional up until block 1000000 (Oct 12), however users are advised
to do it earlier, as after July 14th updating will trigger a blockchain rescan.

The main new feature in 1.9 is the distribution of ARDR assets. See the 1.9.0e
changelog for details.

Performance optimizations for blockchain rescans and for snapshot balance
calculations. Added nxt.dbMaxMemoryRows property to allow setting the H2
MAX_MEMORY_ROWS parameter.

Updated Jetty to version 9.3.10, delete the old lib folder before unpacking on
top.
