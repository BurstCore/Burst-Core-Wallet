/**
 * Publish exchange offer for {@link CurrencyType#EXCHANGEABLE} currency
 * <p>
 * Parameters
 * <ul>
 * <li>currency - currency id of an active currency
 * <li>buyRateNQT - NXT amount for buying a currency unit specified in NQT
 * <li>sellRateNQT - NXT amount for selling a currency unit specified in NQT
 * <li>initialBuySupplyQNT - Initial number of currency units offered to buy by the publisher
 * <li>initialSellSupplyQNT - Initial number of currency units offered for sell by the publisher
 * <li>totalBuyLimitQNT - Total number of currency units which can be bought from the offer
 * <li>totalSellLimitQNT - Total number of currency units which can be sold from the offer
 * <li>expirationHeight - Blockchain height at which the offer is expired
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Publishing an exchange offer internally creates a buy offer and a counter sell offer linked together.
 * Typically the buyRateNQT specified would be less than the sellRateNQT thus allowing the publisher to make profit
 *
 * <p>
 * Each {@link CurrencyBuy} transaction which matches this offer reduces the sell supply and increases the buy supply
 * Similarly, each {@link CurrencySell} transaction which matches this offer reduces the buy supply and increases the sell supply
 * Therefore the multiple buy/sell transaction can be issued against this offer during it's lifetime.
 * However, the total buy limit and sell limit stops exchanging based on this offer after the accumulated buy/sell limit is reached
 * after possibly multiple exchange operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * Only one exchange offer is allowed per account. Publishing a new exchange offer when another exchange offer exists
 * for the account, removes the existing exchange offer and publishes the new exchange offer
