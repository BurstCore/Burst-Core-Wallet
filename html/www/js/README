Sample Ardor APIs for Node JS
=============================

The Node JS module performs local signing and encryption using the same code used by the official Ardor wallet.<br>

Therefore:<br>
Your passphrase is never sent to the remote node when submitting a transaction.<br>
Transaction bytes returned by the remote node are parsed and validated against the submitted data.<br>
Encryption is done locally.<br>
<br>
To use the Node JS module:<br>
- No need to install the NXT software or download the blockchain<br>
- Install Node JS and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/<br>
- From the command prompt type:<br>
npm install ardor-blockchain<br>
cd node_modules/ardor-blockchain/sample<br>
- Configure the remote node, NXT account and default chain by editing the config.json file<br>
- Run the samples using Node JS, for example:<br>
node send.money.js<br>

Warning:<br>
Your passphrase is sent to the remote node only when invoking the /startForging API or other specific APIs which require sending the passphrase to the remote node.<br>
We recommend that you do not use these APIs in your Node JS code.<br>
