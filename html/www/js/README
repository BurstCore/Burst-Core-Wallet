Sample Ardor APIs for Node JS
=============================

The Node JS module performs local signing and encryption using the same code used by the official NXT wallet.

Therefore:
Your passphrase is never sent to the remote node when submitting a transaction. 
Transaction bytes returned by the remote node are parsed and validated against the submitted data.
Encryption is done locally.

To use the Node JS module:
- No need to install the NXT software or download the blockchain
- Install Node JS and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/
- From the command prompt type:
npm install ardor-blockchain
cd node_modules/ardor-blockchain/sample
- Configure the remote node, NXT account and default chain by editing the config.json file
- Run the samples using Node JS, for example:
node send.money.js

Warning:
Your passphrase is sent to the remote node only when invoking the /startForging API or other specific APIs which require sending the passphrase to the remote node. 
We recommend that you do not use these APIs in your Node JS code.
